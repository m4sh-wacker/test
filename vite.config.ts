/**
 * Injects the Content Security Policy into the built index.html.
 *
 * Done at build time rather than written into the source HTML for two reasons.
 * The policy hashes the theme script inlined in index.html, and computing that
 * hash from the emitted markup means it can never go stale when the script is
 * edited. And `connect-src 'none'` — which is the point of the policy, since
 * DecodeBox makes no network requests at all — would block the dev server's
 * hot-reload websocket if it applied during development.
 *
 * Notes on the two relaxations:
 *
 * - `style-src` allows 'unsafe-inline' because React writes inline `style`
 *   attributes. Without a separate `style-src-attr`, those fall back to
 *   `style-src`. CSS injection requires HTML injection to already have
 *   succeeded, and `script-src` — where the real risk lives — stays strict.
 * - `frame-ancestors` is absent because browsers ignore it when it arrives in a
 *   <meta> element, and GitHub Pages cannot set response headers. A deployment
 *   behind a proxy should add it there. See SECURITY.md.
